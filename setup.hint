ldesc: "Googsystray is a system tray app for Google Voice, GMail, Google 
Calendar, Google Reader, and Google Docs. The idea is to be able to keep 
track of all that stuff without having to keep a bunch of browser tabs 
open, or constantly checking them. It notifies on new messages, alerts, 
etc., and provides basic services quickly (Reading or sending a new SMS 
message, or marking an email read, for example.)"
